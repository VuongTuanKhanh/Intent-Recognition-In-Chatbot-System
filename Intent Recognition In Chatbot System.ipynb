You probably have heard about chatbots before, but for those of you who are not familiar with chatbots, here is a quick description. A chatbot is a program that conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. In practice chatbots are used in many different purposes including customer services or information acquisition. Today, most chatbots are accessed via virtual assistants such as Google Assistant, Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, via messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger, or via individual organization’ apps and websites (you can check out Wikipedia article for more information https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot). You are probably wondering what is intent recognition in chatbot systems? Many chatbot systems that contains the intent recognition module which is trying to figuring out what the users want when interacting with the chatbot. For example, an user might say “find restaurants near me”, “find Vietnamese restaurants near me” which all have the “find_restaurant” intent. Usually, a goal-oriented chatbot has a pre-defined set of intents (goal-oriented chatbot is a type of chatbot that helps users do a specific task like set an alarm, find restaurnts, order pizza, …). For example, an virtual assistants might contains the following intents: set_alarm, find_restaurants, open_app, find_video, … So, the purpose of this assignment is trying to find the intent of a user input using this dataset https://github.com/snipsco/nlu-benchmark/tree/master/2017-06-custom-intent-engines. You can treat this problem as a classification problem which classifies a user input text into a category which is an intent. So, in this assignment you will do the following:\n","<br>\n","- Identifying the problem\n","- Learning about machine learning project life cycle and apply it\n","- Collecting the data\n","- Preprocessing the data\n","- Understanding the data\n","- Represent user texts as vectors using TfidfVectorizer\n","- Train, evaluate baseline Logistic Regression model\n","- Train, evaluate cross-validation Logistic Regression model\n","- Learning about word embeddings\n","- Represent user texts as vectors using word embedding with spaCy\n","- Train, evaluate Feedforward Neural Network model\n","- Error analysis\n","- Improving the models\n","- Deploy the models"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mtNvRcc3IMWQ"},"source":["## Identifying the problem and machine learning project life cycle\n","As we have discussed in the previous section, we can view this problem as a machine learning classification problem so you could immediately think, ah let's choose a classification machine learing algorithm and implement it and see the results and then improve it. That process is ok and in fact that is what we are going to do :D, but we will do it more strategically. Before we jump right into the problem let's take a step back and talk about the life cycle of a machine learning project from this book **Machine Learning Yearning** (you can get it for free from the official website https://www.deeplearning.ai/machine-learning-yearning/), so we can apply it to any machine learing project, we highly encourage you to read this book so you can get more details about developing machine projects. The image below is taken from the section 10 from the book that describes a general process when developing a machine learning project."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZZdR7pyJIMWT"},"source":["Here is the description that are copied directly from the book:\n","<br>\n","1. Start off with some idea on how to build the system.\n","2. Implement the idea in code.\n","3. Carry out an experiment which tells me how well the idea worked. (Usually my first few\n","ideas don’t work!)

The faster you can go round this loop, the faster you will make\n","progress. The step 3 usually involves evaluating the models using some metrics on the dev set and doing error analysis so we can improve the models. Here we mention the **dev** set in which you might not have heard of it throughout this specification. The book' main focus is on deep learning projects (but we can use for general machine learning projects as well as mention in the book) and often when doing deep learning project, we have quite a lot of data so people usually split the data into three data sets which are train, dev, test; then we iterate and experiment our methods on the dev set, then we choose the best model using the dev set, then evaluate the best model on the test set only once. The reason we don't experiment with our methods on the test set because we might highly end up overfitting the test set, so we only evaluate the test set once to get our final result is a reasonable way to check our model's generation ability.\n","<br>\n","In the case we don't have much data we can use cross-validation to tune, experiment with our methods then we pick the best model to evaluate on the test set (we have discussed cross-validation in the **Machine learning classification** course).\n","<br>\n","In previous courses in this specification, the process you doing the assignments is some what similar to this process. In this course we will do our assignments using this process and you shold use this process when you do your final project.

Because this is a text classification problem, so let's use our experience with text classification problems. First, we will try out a simple **Logistic Regression** model with **tfidf** as a baseline and then use **cross-validation** to see if we can improve our model. After that, we will try **Feed Forward Neural Network** with **word embedding** to see what happens.

You might ask, what are **word embeddings** exactly? Loosely speaking, they are vector representations of a particular word. But, why do we need them and can we just use **tfidf** to represent texts as vectors? Well, one disadvantage of **tfidf** or **bag of word** is that the feature dimension could be really large and sparse (sparse in the context of vector mean vectors with a lot of zero values). For our problem, the feature dimension size is **48769** (for ngram_range=(1,2)), meanwhile, we only have **13784** examples and the dimension size increases when the vocabulary size increases. That is very inefficient when training with **Neural Network** in terms of computation. When we use **word embedding**, the vector size is fixed no matter the vocabulary size and in practice, the vector size is usually around 100 - 300. Another advantage of **word embedding** is that it is capable of capturing the context of a word in a document, semantic and syntactic similarity, relation with other words. But, how do we generate them? There are many algorithms can be used for producing **word embedding** like **Word2vec**, **Glove**, **Fasttext**, .... They all are unsupervised machine learning algorithms that are usually trained on really large text corpora. Learning how those algorithms work is beyond the scope of this course. All you should care about now is that some people have already trained those **word embedding** algorithms on very large text corpora, they produce us a lookup table that maps a word to a vector. In practice, the lookup table usually contains millions of words or even billion of words. We will use those pre-trained **word embedding** models in later sections to represent our words as vectors and then use those vectors to feed into our **Neural Network** model."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QdHjxDwSIMWs"},"source":["### Using spaCy for word embedding\n","We will use spaCy (https://spacy.io/) which is a python library for solving **Natural Language Process (NLP)** tasks more easily. spaCy offers a lot of features but we only use the pre-trained word vectors feature to look up the embedding vector for an English word.
